# fibonacci-minhash
minhash + fibonacci hashing -> deterministic minhash


## notes
- this isn't the usual algorithm that does banding and shuffling of bits/bytes (eg in the stanford lecture on jaccard similarity)
- hashes cal always be calculated for unseen strings with unseen ngrams
- using a hash to make the algorithm fully deterministic has not been implemented
